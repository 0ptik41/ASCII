## ASCII 
If you use commandline programs, then you've probably seen ascii art. It's been around since terminals,
and I think it's pretty cool. So I wrote this simple python script to generate color ascii art/animations from either pictures or videos/GIFs. 

I might try to tweak it so that it works better automatically on any given image. Some pictures will work better than others with the default settings. The main thing you want to look at is changing the last 2 parameters to calls to `im2ascii` in `encoder.py`.
